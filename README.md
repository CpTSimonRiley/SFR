# F.A.Q.
### What is it?
SFR is an open source mod for [SFD](https://mythologicinteractive.com/SuperfightersDeluxe). It adds new content and tweaks existing mechanics for a better game experience.

### How does it work?
We patch and add game code through reflection and [HarmonyLib](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) in order to add new content. We also edit `.sfdx` and other configuration files.

### Do you have devs consent?
Yes, we do. However read the [license](https://github.com/Odex64/SFR/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for some clarification.

### Can I contribute or create my own mods?
Yes. Everyone with intermediate coding knowledge can create his own mods or even contribute to the main branch.<br>
**You're advised to change SFR version in your own mods, to avoid conflicts with other servers.**<br><br>

# How to install
### Download
You can download this mod [here](https://github.com/Odex64/SFR/releases).

### Installation
Extract the downloaded archive in your `Superfighters Deluxe` folder (if you have a previous SFR installation, make sure to delete that).<br>
Open steam and change `Superfighters Deluxe` launch options to `cmd /k "%command%\..\SFR.exe"`.
